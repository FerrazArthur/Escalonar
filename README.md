### Fell free to use as you want and if you add some new utilities, make sure to  so i can get it too! 
## ENGLISH MENU:
    1-Multiply line by constant
    2-Transform first element non 0 of line into pivot
    3-Add to a line the multiple of another line
    4-Swap lines
    5-Swap collumns
    6-Show system
    7-Show registry of swap's in collumns
    9-Change system
    10-Exit
##
<p>To insert data, you will need to use a ',' to separate elements in the line like a, b, c and a ';' to separate lines</p>
## Example

    >a, b, c;d, e, f; g,h,i
<p>this will create a matriz</p>

    a b c
    d e f
    g h i

##Easiest way to use:
<p>For each line, use option '2' do define a 'pivo' then use option '4' in all other lines to reduze the collumns bellow 'pivo' to zero;</p>
<p>Repeat this processes line by line until you reach the end</p>
<p>Once done, you'll have a identity matriz as 'A' and the 'b' matriz(vector) is going to be the 'x' values to this system.</p>
<p>Note: when you use 'swap collumns', you must keep in mind that you also swap the 'x' order. So i wrote a register of collumns change.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to this proj., please do something to inform the currect order of x based on that! it'll be so cool...</p>
<p>Note, THIS CODE IS FOR LINEAR SISTEMS like Ax=b so A MUST be NxN(square matriz) and b must be a single line with N elements.</p>

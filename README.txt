Fell free to use as you want and if you add some new utilities, make sure to do a commit so i can get it too! 
This software is is portuguese but i'll translate something:
To insert data, you will need to use a ',' to separate elements in the line like a, b, c and a ';' to separate lines, like a, b, c;d, e, f; g,h,i
this will create a matriz
a b c
d e f
g h i
IMPORTANT TO NOTE, THIS CODE IS FOR LINEAR SISTEMS LIKE Ax=b so A MUST be NxN(square matriz) and b must be a single line with N elements.
